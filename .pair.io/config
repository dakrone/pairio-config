# Quickstarts are pre-packaged instances, which allow you to get up
# and running in a short amount of time.  Pair.io will examine your
# repo and try to pick the correct one.
#
# You can override this behavior like so (uncomment):
#quickstart: empty # | ruby19 | rails3 | nodejs | clojure

# Pair.io gives you fine-grained control over what we provision for
# you. Below are the full set of configuration options we support.
